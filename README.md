# Reverse Polish notation

Reverse **Polish notation (RPN)** is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, 
in contrast to Polish notation (PN), which puts the operator before its operands. It is also known as postfix notation. 
It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.  visit [wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Reverse_Polish_notation)
