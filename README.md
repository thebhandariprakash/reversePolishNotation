# Reverse Polish notation

Reverse **Polish notation (RPN)** is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, 
in contrast to Polish notation (PN), which puts the operator before its operands. It is also known as postfix notation. 
It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.  visit [wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Reverse_Polish_notation)


## Implementing Algoritham Using PHP
You can choose one of the expression among the expression ($expression1 0r expression2 or $expression3) and pass to the **calculateResult()** method.

```php 
require_once 'Classes/Rpn.php';

use Classes\Rpn;

$expression1 = "3 2 +";
$expression2 = "2 5 + 3 *";
$expression3 ="5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -";

//creating the instance of Rpm class
$rpn = new Rpn;

$result =  $rpn->calculateResult($expression3);

//output
echo "<h1>Reverse Polish Notation</h1>";

echo "Expression ==>>  ".$expression3. "<br/>";

echo "Result ==>> ".$result;
```


## A Numeric Example

Expression: 5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3  
RPN representation:  

5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -  

The result of this example is 14 and is calculated in the following manner:  

1+2 = 3  
3*4 = 12  
12+5 = 17  
17-3 = 14
